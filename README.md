This app works best when used with camera trap images, but it is also fun to give it silly images like one of your pet and see what classification it comes up with!

I created this repository primarily through this fast.ai deployment instructions that can be found [here](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/02_production.ipynb). The model used is designed to identify several wildlife species from camera trap images from Snapshot Serengeti. If you are interested in the work behind the model creation its repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Jilliane1993/Wildlife_Image_Classification).
